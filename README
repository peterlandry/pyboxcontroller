PyBoxController (any suggestions for a new name?) is a series of classes to
provide easy access to wired usb xbox 360 controllers. USB communication uses
PyUSB, which uses libusb, so this should be available on most platforms
(windows, linux, mac) with python installed.

RockBandMidi.py uses this to create a virtual port, and turn the Rock Band 
Drums into a real midi drumset. pyrtmidi needs to be install for this to work.
